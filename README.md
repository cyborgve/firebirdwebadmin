[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/mariuz/firebirdwebadmin/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/mariuz/firebirdwebadmin)

By now it has the functionalities for
  
* creating, deleting, modifying databases, tables, generators, views, triggers, domains, indices, stored procedures, udf's,     exceptions, roles and database users
* performing sql expressions on databases and display the results
* import and export of data through files in the csv format
* browsing through the contents of tables and views, watching them growing while typing in data
* selecting data for deleting and editing while browsing tables
* inserting, deleting, displaying the contents of blob fields
* diplaying database metadata, browsing the firebird system tables
* database backup and restore, database maintenance

Some of the features are only available if the database- and the web-server are running on the same machine. The reason is that php   have to call the Firebird tools (isql, gsec, gstat, etc.) to perform certain actions.

This is the environment I'm using for the development. Other components are not or less tested. So if you got problems make sure you are not using older software components.
